# CSS scrolling slideshow

In the image file, you need to:
  
- make two rows, the top one in colour and the bottom black & white
- duplicate the first few frames on the left, on the right side too (depending on how many show when the page loads) - this makes it appear as one long scroll

See the comment in the CSS about your image height and width.
